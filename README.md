# EML

This is an experiment in building a concurrent, hierarchical, event-based state
machine programming language intended for implementing distributed management
systems and modeling complex protocols.

# Requirements

- acmart is installed (either [locally which you can get from the github page](https://github.com/borisveytsman/acmart/), or [in your global latex packages](https://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/acmart?lang=en))

## Notes

This example code an experiment to support development and exploration of
concurrent programming languages; it is not an official Google product.
